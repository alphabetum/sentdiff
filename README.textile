h1. Sent Diff

Take a diff by sentence, not just by line. 

h2. Why?

When you're dealing with written text, rather than code, your line breaks only come at the end of paragraphs. Those are pretty large chunks to diff based on. It's not uncommon for me to send something to someone, have them edit it simply by changing it to how they want it, and then have every sentence change. This renders diff useless. 

Instead, sent diff first puts a line break after every sentence (in a temporary file. It leaves the original file as is.) so that if diffs based on a smaller quantum. 

h2. Install

Download the <pre>sentdiff.rb</pre> file. In the directory where it is, run:

<pre>
chmod +x sentdiff.rb
sudo cp sentdiff.rb /usr/bin/sentdiff
</pre>

h2. Usage

After installing, simply run:

<pre>
sentdiff [params that get passed to diff] filename1 filename2
</pre>

It will do a diff by sentence between file1 and file2. 

filename1 and filename2 must be your *last* two params, but you may give any number (including 0) params before that it will just pass right on to diff.
